# App Store Receipt

> [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstorereceipts/validating_receipts_on_the_device): The receipt isn’t necessary if you use [AppTransaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/apptransaction) to validate the app download, or [Transaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction) to validate in-app purchases. Only use the receipt if your app uses the [Original API for In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/original-api-for-in-app-purchase), or needs the receipt to validate the app download because it can’t use AppTransaction.
