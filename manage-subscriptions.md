# Manage Subscriptions 

> [Apple: Auto-renewable subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions/): People can manage their subscriptions in their account settings on the App Store, where they see all renewal options and subscription groups, and can choose to upgrade, crossgrade, or downgrade between subscriptions as often as they like. You can also use the `showManageSubscriptions(in:)` method to allow them to do this within your app.
