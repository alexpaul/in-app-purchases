## `Transaction.updates`

> [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/updates): Use updates to receive new transactions while the app is running. This sequence receives transactions that occur outside of the app, such as Ask to Buy transactions, subscription offer code redemptions, and purchases that customers make in the App Store. It also emits transactions that customers complete in your app on another device.
