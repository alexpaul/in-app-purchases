* Consumable: A product that is used once, after which it becomes depleted and must be purchased again. Example: Fish food for a fishing app.
* Non-Consumable: A product that is purchased once and does not expire or decrease with use. Example: Race track for a game app.
* Auto-Renewable Subscription: A product that allows users to purchase dynamic content for a set period. This type of subscription renews automatically unless cancelled by the user. Example: Monthly subscription for an app offering a streaming service.
* Non-Renewing Subscription: A product that allows users to purchase a service with a limited duration. The content of this in-app purchase can be static. This type of subscription does not renew automatically. Example: One-year subscription to a catalog of archived articles.
